# CovidHealth
This is a covid informative website with a chatbot which made during my internship under Future Ready Talent By Microsoft

I have created covid-19 informative website with azure web Chatbot. I have used Html ,CSS, JavaScript , azure bot service to create this project. The bot can help in answering people questions about Covid-19, like it can tell you the prevention measures , symptoms etc..
And I hosted this website using Azure static web app service .
