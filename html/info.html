            <h2 class="h2-info">What is Coronavirus</h2>
            <p class="p-info">
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold
                to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome (SARS). The virus is named after its shape which takes the form of a crown with protrusions
                around it and hence is known as Corona-virus. <br>
                Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed
                investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary
                camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected
                humans. <br>
                The new strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified during December, 2019 in Wuhan city of
                China. In march 2020 the world health organization (WHO) declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. This
                disese has infected millions of people and is responsible for millions of deaths all over the world.
                The most common symptoms of coronavirus are fever, cough and shortness of breath. <br>
                Coronavirus spreads when one come inContact with covid-19 infected person because it transmits through
                droplets produced while coughing or sneezing by infected person. For prevention and protection from
                virus one must practice following measures: Social Distancing – maintain safe distance from a person who
                having symptoms like coughing and sneezing, Wear mask, hand wash – clean your hands often.

            <h2 class="h2-info">Covid-19 Pandemic In India</h2>
            <p class="p-info">
                The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the world wide pandemic of Corona
                virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). The first case of Covid-19 in India which originated from
                China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number
                of confirmed cases in Asia, and has the second highest number of confirmed
                cases in the world after United State. <br>
                The first person reported in India was from the State of Kerala in late January 2020, and
                according to his travel history, he had returned from China. Since then, there has been a significant
                rise in the number of COVID-19 patients in India’s various states. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi
                have nearly 50% of all India cases, whereas northeast
                states have the least number of cases. Considering the seriousness of the disease, initially, a 21-day
                nationwide lockdown (25 March 2020 to 14 April 2020: LD1.0) was announced by the prime minister of
                India, “Shri. Narendra Modi” to control the transmission of COVID-19 and due to which many industries,
                academic institutes, markets, as well as public gatherings were shut down. After the first lockdown (LD
                1.0), there have been three more lowdown phases in succession (LD2.0: 15 April to 3 May 2020, LD3.0: 4
                May to 17 May 2020, LD4.0: 18 May to 31 May 2020). After that, to restart the Indian economy, two unlock
                phases (UL) have also been announced (UL1.0: 1 June 2020 to 30 June 2020, and UL1.0: 1 July 2020 to 31
                July 2020). <br>
